* small hacking kinda minigame where a player attempts to take over a machine's whole memory and eradicate an enemy virus (a la redcode) with increasing difficulty of crucial programs that shouldn't be overwritten
    * for this, a MIPS32 interpreter is used (note that this does not behave like an actual MIPS32 machine, but is rather programmed like one
